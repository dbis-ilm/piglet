/** Provides various methods for rewriting [[DataflowPlan]]s by wrapping functionality provided by
  * Kiamas [[org.kiama.rewriting.Rewriter]] and [[org.kiama.rewriting.Strategy]] objects.
  *
  * This object keeps an internal [[Strategy]] object that holds all strategies added via [[addStrategy]]. Calling
  * [[rewritePlan]] with a [[DataflowPlan]] will apply ```all``` those strategies to the plan until none applies
  * anymore.
  *
  * ==Low-level methods==
  *
  * Methods that directly handle Strategies are provided:
  *
  * - [[addStrategy]] adds a single strategy to this object. Later calls to [[rewritePlan]] will then use this
  * strategy in addition to all other ones added via this method.
  *
  * - [[addBinaryPigOperatorStrategy]] turns a function operating on two operators of specific subtypes of
  * [[dbis.piglet.op.PigOperator]] that are in a parent-child relationship into a strategy and adds it to this object.
  *
  * - [[buildBinaryPigOperatorStrategy]] is the same as [[addBinaryPigOperatorStrategy]] but doesn't add the
  * strategy to this object.
  *
  * - [[buildRemovalStrategy]] builds a strategy to remove an operator from a [[DataflowPlan]]
  *
  * - [[rewritePlan]] applies a single strategy to a [[DataflowPlan]].
  *
  * ==Higher-level methods==
  *
  * For common operations on [[DataflowPlan]]s, some convenience methods to build and register a strategy are provided:
  *
  * - [[addStrategy]] for easily adding any method with a signature of `Any => Option[PigOperator]` as a strategy
  *
  * - [[addOperatorReplacementStrategy]] is similar to [[addStrategy]] but has some special behaviour that's useful
  * when all the function passed to it does is replacing one operator with another one.
  *
  * - [[merge]] for merging two operators
  *
  * - [[reorder]] for reordering two operators
  *
  * ==DSL==
  *
  * A DSL for easily adding rewriting operations is provided as well, its documented in [[dbis.piglet.plan.rewriting.dsl]].
  *
  * ==DataflowPlan helper methods==
  *
  * Some operations provided by [[DataflowPlan]] objects are not implemented there, but on this object. These include
  *
  * - [[insertAfter]] to insert an operator as a child operator of another
  *
  * - [[remove]] to remove an operator
  *
  * - [[replace]] to replace one operator with another
  *
  * - [[swap]] to swap the positions of two operators
  *
  * ==Helper methods for maintaining connectivity==
  *
  * After a rewriting operation, the `inputs` and `outputs` attribute of operators other than the rewritten ones
  * might be changed (for example to accommodate new or deleted operators). To help maintaining these relationships,
  * the methods [[fixMerge]], [[fixReordering]] and [[pullOpAcrossMultipleInputOp]] in several versions is provided.
  * Their documentation include hints in which cases they apply.
  *
  * @todo Not all links in this documentation link to the correct methods, most notably links to overloaded ones.
